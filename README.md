#### Personal BIO
Hello! My name is Jason. I enjoy challenging myself and learning new things. I've recently decided to take on a career change. 
My hope is that a career in software/web development will help me achieve my familial, career, and financial goals.
So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Southwest Tech. My goals with this program include: finishing the program before my projected finish date, and launching my new career by accepting a job in software or web developement.
